I am a PhD candidate in the School of Computing at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
My research is in the [Theory and Practice of Programming Languages](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/jana/PL/).
I am advised by [Jana Dunfield](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/jana/).
Previously, I studied physics, mathematics and computer science at University of Colorado Boulder.
