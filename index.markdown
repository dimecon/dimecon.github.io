I am a postdoc
working with [Neel Krishnaswami](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/)
at the University of Cambridge.
I completed my PhD in the School of Computing at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario
under the supervision of [Jana Dunfield](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/jana/).
Before that, I studied physics, mathematics and computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Thesis

[Focusing on Modular Refinement Typing](../pdfs/thesis.pdf)

My PhD thesis is an extension of the paper "Focusing on Refinement Typing" that allows multiple measurements on inductive datatypes as well as arrow sorts for indices (so that measures such as whether a list of numbers is in increasing order may be expressed).
